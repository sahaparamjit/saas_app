Stripe Integration
    * Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
    * Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
    and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
    * Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
    should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
    * Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
    to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
    token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
